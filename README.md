# Presentation-template
Base class for all beamer-based presentations

Options:
  
-- draft --
Enables the draft commands provided by this class
Switch it off to make presentation-ready

-- auto_overview --
Generates a slide with details of the current section's current after each \section command

-- auto_sections --
Generates a slide with the section after each \section command

-- monitor_progress --
** Draft **
All slides will have an aggressive red background
Apply the style hok (half-ok) to turn this to a less aggressive orange
Apply the style ok when the slide is as perfect as can be to replace with a white background

-- show_durations --
** Draft **
Overlays each frame (except those tagged plain, this is a bug not a feature) with the expected local and total duration for easy planning of time repartitions


Functionalities:

-- Title slide --
Generated by \dotitlepage
Uses data set by \title, \author, \date, \formation (if any), \titleheader (for the logos), \advisors (if any)

-- duration management --
** Draft **
Frames have an additional option 'duration=<m> min <s>' or duration='<s> s' to specify how long you should spend on then while training. They are automatically accumulated to provide the local and total duration in the lower left part of the footer.
Additionally the command \duration specifies the presentation-wide alloted time to:
  - check whether the sum of invididual durations match
  - inform pdfpc 
  
 -- Frame autonaming --
 If no title is provided for a frame a title is generated by looking first at the subsection then at the section
 Similarly the subtitle is defined by the current comment (set with \sectioncomment{foo}) or the subsubsection
 
 -- End slide and annexes --
 Switch to annexes with the command \doendpages[options]{contents}
 
 if 'contents' is not empty then a plain final slide is generated (thank you slide, summary slide, ...)
 'options' are applied to this slide
 
 -- (Tikz) Local-to --
 The tikz environment localto[options]{node} allows to draw on a node within a local coordinate system:
  - east  @ ( 1,  0)
  - north @ ( 0,  1)
  - west  @ (-1,  0)
  - south @ ( 0, -1)
 
 'options' are applied to this scope
